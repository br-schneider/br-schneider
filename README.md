<h3 >I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder with a Computer Science degree and am currently a founding software engineer at <a href="https://www.meritfirst.us">MeritFirst</a>.</h3>

I build products that turn complex ideas into clear, useful software. Over the years I have shipped production systems and guided lean teams at venture-backed startups, always with an eye on real-world results.

My work sits at the intersection of code and entrepreneurship. I have launched SaaS products, grown design systems, and led early-stage teams from first sketch to public release. Whatever the project, my goal is to make technology friendly and valuable for the people who rely on it.
